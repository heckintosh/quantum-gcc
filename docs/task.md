# Quantum Secure Chat Application - Task List  

## 1. Project Planning & Requirements Gathering  
- [ ] Define project scope, objectives, and expected outcomes.  
- [ ] Research quantum cryptographic protocols (e.g., BB84, E91, Quantum Key Distribution - QKD).  
- [ ] Identify necessary hardware/software requirements for quantum key generation.  
- [ ] Choose programming languages and frameworks for the chat application (e.g., Python, Java, Kotlin, C++).  

## 2. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Implementation  
- [ ] Implement a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol (e.g., BB84).  
- [ ] Develop quantum key generation and exchange mechanism between Alice and Bob.  
- [ ] Simulate quantum key transmission using Python libraries like Qiskit.  
- [ ] Verify key authenticity and detect eavesdropping using quantum properties.  

## 3. Secure Key Storage & Management  
- [ ] Store quantum-generated keys securely (e.g., using a secure enclave, TPM).  
- [ ] Implement key expiration and periodic key refresh mechanisms.  
- [ ] Handle key synchronization between Alice and Bob.  

## 4. Encryption & Secure Communication  
- [ ] Use one-time pad encryption with quantum keys for message encryption.  
- [ ] Implement end-to-end encryption with classical cryptographic fallback.  
- [ ] Ensure real-time message transmission and decryption.  

## 5. Chat Application Development  
- [ ] Build a basic UI for Alice and Bob to communicate.  
- [ ] Integrate messaging protocol (WebSocket, MQTT, or HTTP-based).  
- [ ] Implement message queueing for offline delivery.  
- [ ] Add features like timestamps, read receipts, and notifications.  

## 6. Security Measures & Attack Prevention  
- [ ] Implement post-quantum cryptographic methods for fallback security.  
- [ ] Detect and prevent MITM attacks on classical communication channels.  
- [ ] Secure API endpoints and network communication using TLS 1.3.  

## 7. Testing & Validation  
- [ ] Perform unit tests for quantum key exchange and encryption.  
- [ ] Test system resilience against quantum and classical attacks.  
- [ ] Simulate an eavesdropper attack to validate QKD security.  

## 8. Deployment & Documentation  
- [ ] Deploy the application on a secure server or local quantum network.  
- [ ] Document the project architecture, encryption methods, and key management.  
- [ ] Provide usage instructions and troubleshooting guides.  

## 9. Future Enhancements & Optimizations  
- [ ] Optimize quantum key generation speed.  
- [ ] Improve UI/UX for better user experience.  
- [ ] Extend the system for group chats and multi-user quantum-secure communication.
